CIS 440 - ReadMe for my Personal Project

This semester we've seen a lot of different projects come through a  most of them were websites. All of 
the projects appeared to look nice and have a few key features which were all similar and I wanted to 
see how some of them were created. I decided to make a wordpress site as an information page for my
group's project to help explain BSIMM and Infusionsofts goals. I decided upon using wordpress after seeing 
how clean, clear and crisp the student's/other group's websites were and how quickly they were able to develop
them. 

I found out how easy it was to get off the ground immediately, which is awesome for Agile/Scrums 
Rapid Application Development goals. You can easily have a decent looking working website within a couple
of hours if you know what you're doing. 

It took me a while to get all of the settings lined up properly and tinkering with all of the robust features
in order to get it to look more like a website and less like a blog. The functionalty seems to change
slightly depending on what theme you decide to use, and unfortunatly I couldn't afford to buy the professional
verison of the program in order modify the code itself too much, although that would have been really useful 
and insightful.

I also looked into hosting and it wouldn't be very difficult to pair it with a domain from wordpress(around $20 a year)
or to host it on my own domains a little bit cheaper through goDaddy as they have a plugin for it, and you can
transfer over your site via an exportable XML file which you can get directly from wordpress.
